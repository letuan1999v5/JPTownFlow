  "creditHowItWorksTitle": "1. How do \"Credits\" work?",
  "creditHowItWorksText": "Every time you ask the AI to do something (like translate, chat, or analyze images), the app will deduct a corresponding amount of Credits. The cost of each action is not fixed – it depends on 3 factors:",
  "creditFactorFeature": "Feature you use: Simple tasks (like Translation) will cost much less Credits than complex tasks (like Web Browsing & Summarization).",
  "creditFactorModel": "AI model you choose: You have full control over your choice.",
  "creditModelExplanation": "There are three models: lite, standard and pro. Lite is the cheapest and fastest model, pro is more expensive and slower because it requires deeper thinking, but the results are more accurate. You should choose the model depending on the complexity of the request to optimize costs.",
  "creditFactorComplexity": "Request complexity: A long question or a document you paste to summarize will cost more Credits than a short question. The difficulty of the question is also a factor.",
  "creditWhyChatCostsMoreTitle": "2. Why does longer chat cost more Credits?",
  "creditWhyChatCostsMoreText": "To answer you, the AI must \"remember\" the entire conversation from start to finish.",
  "creditChatExample1": "Turn 1: AI only needs to remember 1 question. (Costs fewer Credits)",
  "creditChatExample20": "Turn 20: AI must \"re-read\" the previous 19 turns to understand context. (Costs more Credits)",
  "creditChatExplanation": "This is how AI maintains conversation flow, but it also increases costs.",
  "creditHowToTrackTitle": "3. How do I know how much was deducted?",
  "creditHowToTrackText": "Your remaining credits will always be displayed on AI-powered features. You can purchase additional credits if needed, and these credits will never expire. The system will always prioritize deducting expiring credits first, then your purchased credits.",
  "creditSavingTipsTitle": "Credit Saving Tips",
  "creditTip1Title": "Use the Right Model",
  "creditTip1Text": "Don't use the Pro model just to translate one word. Use Lite or Standard instead.",
  "creditTip2Title": "Start a New Chat",
  "creditTip2Text": "When you want to switch to a completely new topic (for example, from cooking to fashion), tap \"New Chat\". The new chat won't need to remember anything from the \"cooking\" section, saving you a certain amount of credits.",
